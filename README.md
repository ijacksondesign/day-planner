## Reflection <a name="reflection"></a>
I didn't think I was actually going to finish this one as I got sick over the weekend and could not focus. Besides dealing with whatever bug I had, I also struggled with writing my code despite knowing what I wanted it to do. My biggest struggle was with callback functions and knowing when to pass in parameters. 

In the end I pulled through and was able to complete the assignment with a better understanding of writing functions, selecting objects in the DOM, and dynamically updating a web page.
